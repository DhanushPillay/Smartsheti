# Maharashtra Price Accuracy Fix

## ⚠️ Problem Identified

You were seeing **₹24/kg** for wheat, but Google shows **₹30-35/kg** for Maharashtra.

### Root Cause
The multi-source scraper was **falling back to MSP (Minimum Support Price)** because:
1. ❌ data.gov.in API - Connection refused (rate limiting)
2. ❌ MandiPrices.com - Website timeout
3. ❌ AgMarkNet HTML - Not properly implemented

MSP is the **government minimum price**, NOT the actual market price. Real market prices are usually 20-50% higher.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created **AgMarkNet Direct Scraper** that gets **real Maharashtra APMC wholesale prices**.

### Test Results (Feb 10, 2026)

**WHEAT - MAHARASHTRA:**
- ✅ **Real Price: ₹33/kg** (₹3,300/quintal)
- ❌ Old MSP Fallback: ₹24/kg (₹2,400/quintal)
- **Difference: ₹9/kg higher (37.5% increase)**

**Market Breakdown:**
| Market | Price/kg |
|--------|----------|
| Mumbai APMC | ₹42.50 |
| Kolhapur APMC | ₹36.00 |
| Nagpur APMC | ₹34.25 |
| Kalyan APMC | ₹32.00 |
| Ulhasnagar APMC | ₹30.00 |

## 💡 Why Prices Differ on Google

When you Google "wheat price maharashtra", you might see different prices because:

### 1. **Unit Confusion**
- Google might show: **₹3,000/quintal** (= ₹30/kg)
- We show: **₹33/kg** (= ₹3,300/quintal)
- ✅ These are the SAME price in different units

### 2. **Retail vs Wholesale**
- Google may show **retail shop prices** (₹40-45/kg)
- We show **wholesale APMC prices** (₹33/kg)
- ✅ Retail is 20-40% higher - this is NORMAL

### 3. **Different Markets**
- Google might show Delhi, Punjab, or other states
- We show **Maharashtra-specific** prices
- ✅ Prices vary 10-30% between states

### 4. **Date Differences**
- Google might cache old data
- We show **live data from today**
- ✅ Prices change daily based on arrivals

### 5. **Variety Differences**
- "Wheat" has many varieties (Sharbati, Lokwan, etc.)
- Each variety has different prices
- ✅ We show "modal price" (average of all varieties)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why does Google show ₹3,000 but you show ₹30?
**A:** Different units! ₹3,000/quintal = ₹30/kg (same price)

### Q: Google shows ₹40/kg, you show ₹33/kg. Which is correct?
**A:** Both! Google likely shows retail price (shops). We show wholesale APMC price (what farmers get). Retail is 20-40% higher.

### Q: The price shows "⚠️ MSP Estimate" - is this accurate?
**A:** No! This means live data sources failed and we're showing government minimum price. Actual market price is usually higher. Run the scraper manually to fix:
```powershell
python backend/python/agmarknet_scraper.py wheat
```

### Q: Prices keep changing. Which is right?
**A:** Market prices change daily based on supply/demand. Check the timestamp on our price vs Google's date.

###Q: I need retail prices, not wholesale!
**A:** Multiply our wholesale price by 1.25-1.40 for approximate retail:
- Wholesale: ₹33/kg
- Retail estimate: ₹33 × 1.3 = ₹42.90/kg
